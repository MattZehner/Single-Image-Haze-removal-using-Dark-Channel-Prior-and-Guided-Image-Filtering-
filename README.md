# Single-Image-Haze-removal-using-Dark-Channel-Prior-and-Guided-Image-Filtering-
A MATLAB implementation of the algorithm described in the paper by He et al. titled "Single Image Haze Removal using Dark Channel Prior" [1] for haze removal from a single image (RGB and Grayscale). The results from the previous method were refined using the approach described in the paper by the same author He et al. titled "Guided Image Filtering" [2]

This was completed as a part of the final project for the ECEN642 Digital Image Processing course at Texas A&M University.
