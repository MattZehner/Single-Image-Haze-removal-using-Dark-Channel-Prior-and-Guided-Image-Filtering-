# Single-Image-Haze-removal-using-Dark-Channel-Prior-and-Guided-Image-Filtering-
A MATLAB implementation of the algorithm described in the paper by He et al. titled "Single Image Haze Removal using Dark Channel Prior" [1] for haze removal from a single image (RGB and Grayscale). The results from the previous method were refined using the approach described in the paper by the same author He et al. titled "Guided Image Filtering" [2]

This was completed as a part of the final project for the ECEN642 Digital Image Processing course at Texas A&M University.

## Steps to execute- ##
1. The main function to be executed is the file with the name as "MorningViewMode". Please run that function in Matlab. 
2. The input hazy images are in the folder - Image_Set --> Input_Hazy_Images. Please move the image that you want to test for in the folder containing the program files. 
3. The resultant output - Haze Free images are present in the folder Image_Set --> Results.
